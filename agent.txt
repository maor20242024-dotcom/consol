AGENT POLICY - Imperium Gate

This file exists to instruct any automated agent (or human assistant) working on this repository about the documentation workflow and allowed modifications.

Rules for any agent in any session:

- Only update existing Markdown files inside the `docs/` folder when you make changes related to those documents.
- Do NOT create new Markdown files under `docs/` unless explicitly approved by a human maintainer.
- If you need to add new information, update the most relevant existing file (e.g., `APPLICATION_STATUS.md`, `UPDATES.md`, `SETUP_COMPLETE.md`) instead of creating a new file.
- Before deleting or permanently removing any documentation file, create an archival copy under `docs/ARCHIVE/` and obtain explicit confirmation from the project owner.
- Always run a quick sanity check after edits:
  1. Validate JSON and env files (no secrets leak to public channels).
  2. Restart the dev server only from the dedicated server terminal.
  3. Do not run commands in the server terminal other than `npm run dev`.
- When modifying `.env` files or any credential material, notify the owner and recommend rotating any keys that were exposed.

Failure to follow these rules may break the local development server or leak sensitive keys.
